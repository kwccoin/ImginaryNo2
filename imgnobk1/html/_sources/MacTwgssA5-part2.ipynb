In particular, all observer basically see himself/herself as stationary and everything is moving.  And by observing others, he knows that might be he is at rest or in a velocity, but all the others are relative to him.  If he travels 100 km/hr, a train travel 110 km/hr would look like 10 km/hr.  There is no absolute velocity but observer dependent.\n",

As its speed is a constant, we can just use travel at 45 degree or 1 sec as one unit on the time axis pointing upwards and 300 million meter as one unit on the x axis.  In fact we usually take ct not just t and hence both x and y axis have the same unit.  2 observers crossing each other at one point , we will set that crossing point as origin, the speed they travel assume constant will be $v$ and $-v$ and the line of operation (as we can orient the world so that only x matters).

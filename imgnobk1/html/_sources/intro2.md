Welcome to my little web site about imaginery number
Hopeful may generate PDF/latex/book ... somehow.

This is based on [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).  Just like everything in here, everything is just a result of my hobby and learning.

The logo is from [the Wikipedia page on Imaginery Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number); copyright are theirs.

And later "chapters" is just the sample pages from the book of Jupyter Book.  Keep them as it is my testing whether it is the setup issue (if even they cannot be presented) or it is on my page content.  Sorry, incomplete, draft, ...

## In case of doubt ... it is just a hobby not for "production"

I am not sure anything is correct here.  As said just my hobby and hence if you find anything error, mistake, omission, ... etc., please do alert me.

Check out the content pages here to see more.  Just do not not trust it is right.  Take them at best as a starting point of your investigation. If I can make you curious about the world, that is all what I aim for!!!

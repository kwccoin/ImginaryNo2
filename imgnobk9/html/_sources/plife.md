## trying to incoporate some simulate life based on html and pygame sample from 
##   [Create Artificial Life From Simple Rules - Particle Life #simulation #programming #javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kx4Y9TVMGg)

He has a lot in the sournce like even Windows binary.  I just try the html and py.  I do not expect py to work but html seems ok.

Try both md and ipynb version (later need ! in md there I guess)

[subdir-non3D](plife_html_etc/particle_life.html "plife non-3D")

[subdir-3D](plife_html_etc/particle_life_3d.html "plife-3D")

do not want to use the current directory under dot slash or just plan html
